I only re-implemented their algorithm into ease-to-use encode/decode functions.

Here is the message left by the dev:
```
Made by Twilight Sparkle (@yourcompanionAI).

Please do not reimplement without crediting me!
I know the method is simple... but I'm the one who did it first!
Let me hang out on your credits list! 
```

I don't really know who that is, or their github profile, so thats the only credit I can give.
